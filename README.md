# Machine-Learning:
## This project which I have created uses various Machine Learning Models to predict the prices of Used Cars.
## Models Used:XGBOOST,LINEAR REGRESSOR,LIGHTGBM REGRESSOR,GRADIENT BOOSTING REGRESSOR and RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR
I have also done Data Analysis and Data Visualization on the data.
I have trained,tested and implemented various other techniques like Label Encoding,Feature Scaling and Data Cleaning Techniques in the model.
I have also attained an accuracy of 97% prediction accuracy in this project.
